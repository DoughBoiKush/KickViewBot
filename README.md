# Kick View Bot

Hello, my name is AnonX. I created a simple view bot for the new streaming site called kick.com, I have been working on this for quite some time now to ensure that it had little to no issues upon it's public release.

This tool is to only be used for preventing view botting on your own website, via testing using this tool. I do not condone using this on kick.com or any other streaming platform.

## Installation

Install using these commands

```bash
  pip install tkinter
  pip install selenium
  python KickViewBot.py

```

## Discord & Guilded
If you need any help or if you would just like to be up to date on future updates for this tool, please join the Discord server. I also added a guilded server just in case the Discord server gets banned (Guilded is a Discord alternative with less rules).

## Features

- Multi-Threading
- Low CPU Usage
- No viewer drop-offs

# The Future Of The Tool
I have plans to make a paid version of the tool with improved functionality, better UI and better performance. I will also be actively updating the free tool to add new features and fix bugs or other issues that may come up with the script.
    
## Credit
I do ask that anyone that uses this tool please leave the credits in the script, yes the script is open source but getting credit for something I made is just as cool as it being free to use. Thank You!
